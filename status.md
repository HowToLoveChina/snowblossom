# Works

* POW difficulty adjustment (needs tuning, probably)
* Miners connecting, getting block template and mining (not full blocks yet)
* miners using multiple snow fields as needed
* Block DB, DB in general
* UTXO hashed Trie db
* Making snow fields for PoW
* PoW in general with proofs and verification
* blocks forming a chain
* transactions
* merkle root of transactions
* utxo root hash updates and validation
* Having a mempool and putting transactions into blocks
* lite client api (absolutely bare minimum works)


# Does not work

* switching to best chain
* p2p networking
* any sort of wallet (via lite client)
* UPNP ports
* onion/proxy support
* snow storms
